# **Push_swap**

## :speech_balloon: **About**
Implementation of a data sorting algorithm, that sorts data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. 
The push_swap program sorts the stack given as an argument and prints the actions performed by the algorithm. 
As a bonus a tester was developed that checks if the stack is sorted by the actions performed and counts them.

## :link: **Compilation**
To compile the program you should run `make`.
This rule will generate an executable file named `pipex`.

To launch the executable you should follow this syntax:

```sh
$ ./pipex infile cmd1 cmd2 outfile
```

# Bonus Part

## üíé **Features**
```
- Supports multiple pipes, enabling users to chain multiple commands together
- Supports append redirections (including here document)
